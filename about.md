As an outsider looking into the world of artificial intelligence, I found myself fascinated by the research happening at Georgia Tech. However, I quickly realized that the gap between academic papers and public understanding was vast. This realized sparked an idea: what if we could bridge this divide? Thus, the Georgia Tech AI Podcast was born.

Our mission is simple yet ambitious - to make cutting-edge AI research accessible to everyone. We divide into the minds of top researchers at Tech who are shaping the future of the intelligence age.

Each episode is a journey of discovery, where we unravel complex concepts and reveal the human stories behind the code. Join us as we demystify AI, one conversation at a time. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a student, or simply curious about how AI is changing our world, this podcast is your gateway to understanding the future being built today at Georgia Tech.
