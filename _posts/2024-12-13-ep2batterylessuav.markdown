**Choosing projects.** My approach to selecting projects is straightforward: I pursue ideas that I find interesting and enjoyable. This often leads to opportunities to learn new skills, solve novel problems, or tackle existing challenges in innovative ways. While I generate numerous ideas, I focus on those that are fun for me, and some of those eventually prove successful. Sustainability is a significant driving force behind this. I’m particularly interested in: 1) making things last longer, and 2) capturing energy from the surrounding environment in more meaningful and useful ways. There’s abundant energy in our environment that’s often overlooked or unused. Relying on fossil fuels and batteries can have adverse environmental impacts. My aim is to develop more sustainable solutions for everyday devices and objects by harnessing ambient energy.

**Narrowing it down.** The project that perfectly embodies this approach towards sustainable innovation is the battery-free UAV project. This initiative combines existing drone technologies with a completely battery-free system, pushing the limits of both flight capabilities and energy harvesting. The goal is to create a drone that can fly for as long as sunlight is available, enabling significantly longer flight times and missions. This battery-free UAV technology could revolutionize various applications, including environmental monitoring, wildlife observation, volcano activity monitoring, and city air quality assessment.

**Challenges ahead.** The current state-of-the-art in drone technology primarily relies on lithium-ion batteries, which presents several challenges: 1) weight: while lithium-ion batteries are relatively heavy, they remain one of the best energy storage options available for drones; 2) degradation: battery performance degrades over time, especially with frequent use and high current draw, which is typical in drone operations. This leads to frequent replacements in industrial applications, financial burden, and environmental concerns due to the toxic nature of lithium-ion batteries and difficulties in safe recycling and disposal. The vision for battery-free drones aims to address these issues by harvesting energy from the environment, eliminating the need for batteries, and potentially created fully sustainable and biodegradable UAVs. Several factors currently limit the realization of this vision. For one, funding is a problem, as securing financial resources for research and development can be an uphill battle. Other reasons include materials research (investigating suitable materials for drone construction and energy harvesting), design optimization (balancing payload capacity, sustainable flight, and energy harvesting capabilities), and interdisciplinary expertise (the current team lacks aerospace engineering specialists, relying on mechanical and electrical engineering backgrounds). The complexity of the project lies in its numerous interconnected variables and design constraints.

**Flapping wings.** They’re efficient, just like nature. The drone can switch between high-power flapping for lift and thrust, and low-power gliding to conserve energy. Flapping provides a good mix of maneuverability and stability in flight. The flapping motion has two parts: a downward flap, where the wings move down, pushing air down and creating lift, and an upward flap, where the wings move up, which can create an unwanted downward force. Birds have clever ways to deal with this downward force. Their feathers form a solid surface on the down flap but let air through on the up flap. This reduces the downward force. Birds also adjust their wing angles to manage airflow during different parts of the flap. Our research team is trying to copy these bird techniques, but it’s challenging. Right now, their drone can fly, but it still creates too much downward force on the upward flap. They’re working on new ideas to solve this problem.

**Material selection.** This is the crucial bit. The team had to balance durability, weight, and energy generation capabilities. For the body, the choice was straightforward. We needed something strong enough to withstand crashes but light enough to fly reliably. Carbon fiber was the clear winner in terms of strength-to-weight ratio. The wings presented a more complex challenge. Initially, the team considered making the wings out of solar panels to maximize energy harvesting. However, this idea had a major flaw: as the wings flap, the angle of the solar panels to the sun constantly changes. This would result in inconsistent energy production, potentially leading to inefficient flapping or even failure to complete a flap cycle. To solve this problem, we came up with a ‘solar parachute’ design. Solar panels sit on top of the drone, like a small canopy. While this adds some drag, it is less problematic than the energy loss from constantly changing panel angles on the wings. For the wing material itself, we went with a lightweight nylon-type fabric. The material is flexible enough to generate lift, light enough to keep the motor size small, and durable enough to survive a few crashes. Keeping the wings light was crucial. Heavier wings would require a larger motor, which in turn would need more energy, leading to a cycle of increasing weight and power demands.

**Energy management.** The team uses supercapacitors instead of traditional batteries. These are ‘high-capacity capacitors’ that serve a small energy buffer between the solar panels and the drone’s systems. They help maximize solar panel efficiency. Using a maximum power point tracker (MPPT), the drone can adjust its power draw to get the most energy from the solar panels. The supercapacitor helps stabilize this process. In addition to maximizing efficiency, it handles intermittent power. If there is a sudden drop in solar energy (say from cloud cover), the supercapacitor provides enough power to keep the drone stable until it can harvest more energy. However, supercapacitors are much less energy-dense than batteries, which creates challenges. To address this, the team developed an energy-aware flight controller. This system dynamically adjusts flight conditions based on harvested energy, changes throttle limits and motor speeds in real-time, predicts energy harvesting based on recent trends, and balances energy input and output to maintain flight. Unlike traditional drones that only worry about low battery levels when it’s time to land, this system constantly manages energy levels. It looks at the current energy being harvested, recent energy accumulation trends, and past energy consumption trends. Using this information, the controller predicts whether to lower or increase throttle, ensuring that energy input is always greater than or equal to energy output. When the supercapacitor has enough charge, the system can even push for higher performance. This dynamic approach allows the battery-free drone to adapt to changing energy conditions in real-time, making the most of its limited energy storage capacity.

**A practical reality.** There’s so much potential with battery-free UAVs becoming ubiquitous, and there are few things we would need to get right. *1) Expand energy harvesting in UAVs.* More UAVs would need to be developed with energy harvesting capabilities, including both battery-free and battery-powered models. The focus should be on increasing reliance on harvested energy rather than using it solely for minor battery life extension. *2) Address energy harvesting challenges.* We must tackle issues related to incorporating energy harvesting devices, such as extra weight, unreliable power supply, and the potential for sudden power loss. *3) Adapt control systems.* This entails the development of control systems that can handle intermittent power supply and creating planning algorithms that account for energy uncertainty. *4) Explore alternative UAV designs.* The focus should be fixed-wing or flapping-wing designs over multi-rotor configurations. These designs allow for gliding or hovering with minimal power, reducing crash risk during low-power states. *5) Encourage more research.* Promote further studies in battery-free UAV technology and explore the potential for long-duration, intervention-free flights. *6) Improve energy harvesting efficiency.* Develop more efficient energy harvesting mechanisms and optimize energy storage and utilization systems. *7) Miniaturization.* Work on reducing the size of battery-free UAVs to make them a practical reality for various applications.

**Current reception.** While the technology is still in its early stages, it has received a fair amount of attention relative to the work done so far. Our team believes that once we achieve sustainable flight for extended periods (hours), interest will likely increase significantly. We’re working on launching a startup based on this technology. We have received positive feedback from startup competitions and groups like CreateX and SustainX. Initial skepticism often turns into excitement once the concept and progress are explained.

**Battery-free inference.** Protean was a project led by one of my colleagues, Abu Bakar, who has now graduated. The idea behind this project was to create a prototyping platform to make research into battery-free computing more accessible, primarily for researchers or hobbyists trying to enter the field and learn more about it. Battery-free computing requires a lot of circuitry that isn’t necessary for traditional computing. For example, you need to be able to keep track of time even after losing power. In a battery-free computer, you can lose power, but you need to be able to tell how long it’s been since the last power outage. Most battery-free computing technologies use devices called timekeepers for this purpose. Battery-free computers typically rely on some sort of energy harvesting mechanism, such as solar panels, soil-powered harvesting, wind-powered harvesting, or thermal energy. You need an input that can accept energy from a harvester, which is quite different from a traditional power source. This often requires components like a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT).

**Digging into thresholds.** A crucial component in battery-free systems is the thresholding mechanism. This is necessary due to the relationship between voltage and current in electrical systems. When a system turns on, it typically draws a surge of current, known as inrush current. This relationship is governed by Ohm’s Law: I = V/R, where I is current, V is voltage, and R is resistance. When a battery-free system turns on at the lower end of its operating voltage range, it draws a sudden, large current (spike) to charge capacitors and start components. This current spike causes a voltage drop due to the internal resistance of the power source and circuit. The voltage drop can be significant enough to bring the system voltage below its minimum operating threshold. The voltage drop prevents the system from maintaining the minimum required voltage for operation. Without sufficient voltage, the system cannot perform its intended functions or computations. Repeated power-on attempts in this state can stress components and potentially cause damage. To prevent this issue, a thresholding mechanism is employed. It disconnects the energy storage from the computational components until a higher voltage is reached. The higher voltage provides a buffer against the initial current spike. Once the threshold is reached, the system can turn on and operate without immediately dropping below its minimum voltage. In Protean, we have a variable threshold. Based on the complexity and number of tasks to be performed, you can change the voltage threshold. For a small, quick task, you can set a lower threshold and turn on sooner. For more complex tasks, you can set a higher threshold, wait longer to accumulate more energy, and then perform more work once the system is awake.

**Modular design.** We wanted to create a modular system where you can snap on different peripherals. If you want to test facial recognition in a battery-free system, you can snap on a camera system to our module. You can add microphones, ADCs, or create your own sensor boards. We can dynamically control power to each sensor, either external or internal to the board, using load switches. This allows for a super low power state where essentially nothing is receiving power. Additionally, you can replace the microcontroller itself if you want to develop on a new platform. We use a connector similar to M.2 SSDs, called Micromod from SparkFun. This allows our platform to accept various microcontroller packages, so you can use whatever microcontroller you want with whatever sensors you want to create any battery-free application. All the extra components needed for battery-free computing are integrated into the board: an energy harvester input, a variable threshold mechanism, timekeeping capabilities, and load switches to control power to everything.

**Common theme.** There’s a red thread tying Protean with battery-free UAVs. Both rely on using energy intelligently and adapting to the environment. Once you go battery-free, you need to be much more careful with how you use energy because it becomes a very limited resource. With batteries, you don’t have to worry about energy until it’s time to replace the battery. The only energy conservation concern there is extending battery life. In day-to-day coding, you don’t worry about what happens if your code stops executing at a particular line. In battery-free systems, you must be more nuanced in how you design your hardware and write your code to work effectively.

**Phantom lungs.** The phantom lungs project originated from my advisor Alex Adams’ PhD work, where he created phantom lungs essentially to simulate smoking vapes. This is currently being used for a project we’re working on, continuing the work my advisor did in the past. We’re trying to monitor e-cigarette usage and record data on when a person vapes, as well as bodily signals such as heart rate or fidgeting, or other biometric markers. The goal is to predict and provide just-in-time interventions to stop people when they’re craving rather than after they’ve already smoked. Currently, we’re at a stage where we’re trying to identify the bio-signals that relate to a person craving smoke and how we can prevent them from smoking through intervention. Phantom organs, in general, are an excellent way to test things that would normally require human subjects without actually needing humans. For example, without a phantom lung, I would have to smoke perhaps 10 or 20 e-cigarettes to run all the experiments we need for a paper, not to mention the tests required just to design the device. It's not even at the experiment stage where we're validating the device; even when we're designing, we need to know when a vape is occurring and how to tune our circuits. We need to run many tests, and doing all of that with a human subject adds much more unreliability and variance to your tests. With a phantom organ, the idea is that you can replicate the physical system. For example, in a phantom lung, we're not actually creating a whole lung that can use oxygen and convert it into the bloodstream. The only thing our lung does is compress like a plunger, and when it's going back to its original state, it sucks in air. That's it. We're recreating the suction force that occurs when you're inhaling from an e-cigarette. That's what we wanted to capture and monitor. A phantom organ is usually very targeted to the specific thing you're trying to sense. It's about replicating the physics behind that process without having to rely on a human to do it repeatedly.

**Moving forward.** There’s so much on my plate. I'm mostly working on a new energy harvesting modality in which we should be able to gather a lot more energy from impacts. We hope to publish this research soon. Very recently, just before you invited me for this podcast, I was working on the smoking paper. We've created a device that can snap onto existing e-cigarettes to monitor when users are vaping, record all of that data, and send it to an iPhone. I’m continuing my work on battery-free UAVs as well as a few soft robotics projects.
